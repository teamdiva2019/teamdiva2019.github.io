										In the early stages of our project, we referenced research papers from other virtual reality and data science projects to better understand the current state of data visualization. Our preliminary research culminated in a methodology paper, which discussed the technical strategies needed to make a usable product. Then, we began working on a thesis proposal draft, which outlined our methodology as well as a set of goals for the next four years. We began exploring Unity and Unreal Engine, and ultimately decided to use Unreal for our project.

									<h2>Spring 2017</h2>

								<p>
									Development began in spring 2017, when we split the DIVA team into two subteams: analysis and visualization. The analysis group began testing the effectiveness of different data preprocessing methods, while the visualization group developed the framework for the environment. In addition to implementing static coastline border data, the visualization subteam was able to display a time-dependent temperature dataset. During this time, we finalized and presented our thesis proposal to an expert panel. Near the end of the semester, we also won the University Libraries Award for Outstanding Gemstone Team &#8212 see photos <a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/umd_libraries/albums/72157682837256805/ target="_blank">here</a>.

									Having established the framework for visualization in our virtual environment, we decided to focus our efforts on developing in Unreal Engine. Doing so introduced the User Interface subteam whose primary goal was to develop an interactive UI for the Oculus, using Leap Motion

								<p>Currently, our analysis subteam is working on implementing their chosen preprocessing methods on real climate datasets, and exploring color mapping based on properties of the data. The visualization subteam is adding bathymetry and topography data to the globe, and initializing basic interactive features. By the end of the summer, our goal is be able to interact with datasets we load in the VR environment, to be viewed in an Oculus Rift headset.</p>

									<h2>Future</h2>
								</header>
								<p> In fall 2017, we will start our LaunchUMD campaign to raise money for hardware and potential conference travel. Once our alpha prototype is completed — hopefully by the end of the calendar year — we’ll begin our first focus group. We’ll work with design and UI/UX experts via facilitated discussion to assess the intuitiveness of the data visualization environment. Using this feedback, we will start working on a beta prototype. Our second focus group will be composed of students at UMD who are interested in using virtual reality. Their comments will be used to further the functionality and usability of the environment for the final prototype. Our product will then be evaluated by climate scientists. The goal is to use their ideas to make final changes, and then publish and present our work.</p>
