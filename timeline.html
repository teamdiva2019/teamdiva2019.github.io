										In the early stages of our project, we referenced research papers from other virtual reality and data science projects to better understand the current state of data visualization. Our preliminary research culminated in a methodology paper, which discussed the technical strategies needed to make a usable product. Then, we began working on a thesis proposal draft, which outlined our methodology as well as a set of goals for the next four years. We began exploring Unity and Unreal Engine, and ultimately decided to use Unreal for our project.

									<h2>Spring 2017</h2>

								<p>
									Development began in spring 2017, when we split the DIVA team into two subteams: analysis and visualization. The analysis group began testing the effectiveness of different data preprocessing methods, while the visualization group developed the framework for the environment. In addition to implementing static coastline border data, the visualization subteam was able to display a time-dependent temperature dataset. During this time, we finalized and presented our thesis proposal to an expert panel. Near the end of the semester, we also won the University Libraries Award for Outstanding Gemstone Team &#8212 see photos <a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/umd_libraries/albums/72157682837256805/ target="_blank">here</a>.

									Having established the framework for visualization in our virtual environment, we decided to focus our efforts on developing in Unreal Engine. Doing so introduced the User Interface subteam whose primary goal was to develop an interactive UI for the Oculus, using <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/" target="_blank"> Leap Motion</a> hardware and software. Meanwhile the visualization team was working on a case study to visualize localized high-resolution datasets &#8212 they developed a working visualization of the Chesapeake Bay during Hurricane Harvey. This work culminated in the our presentation at Junior Colloquia, for which we won second place.

									<h2>Current</h2>

								<p>Currently, our focus has shifted to finalizing a product to show off to our first focus group for feedback. All subteams are putting finishing touches on their work. We are focusing on core capabilities, adding basic and interactive analysis capabilities, and developing more advanced visualization enhancement techniques. Simultaneously, we are working on drafting our poster for Undergraduate Research Day, as well as preparing to write our senior thesis.</p>

									<h2>Future</h2>
								</header>
								<p> After completing our first focus group, we will use their feedback to develop a beta prototype. Our second focus group will be composed of students at UMD who are interested in using virtual reality. Their comments will be used to further the functionality and usability of the environment for the final prototype. Our product will then be evaluated by climate scientists. The goal is to use their ideas to make final changes, and then publish and present our work. Once all feedback has been received and corresponding changes implemented, we intend to apply to various conferences around late 2017 or early 2018 to share our findings with researchers. Finally, upon completing our thesis, we will defend our research at the Senior Thesis Conference, </p>
